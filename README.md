# Dog vs Forest Classifier
Deep learning nueral network that correctly classifies images as a dog or a forest -
For final test I used a photo or my dog Arepa and the model correctly classified her as a dog. 
She is, indeed, a very good dog!

## Test Images

Model correctly predicts that Arepa is 100% a dog an a forest is 100% a forest.

# Classify Dogs and Cats

## Project Overview

This project utilizes the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset (URLs.PETS)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between photos of dogs and cats.

The core of the project is a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LyGQd0sJo1NoJXV1vfLTiNW9_te2wmlL#scrollTo=YC918zFRg0tD), which provides a comprehensive and interactive environment for training and testing the model. 

The notebook guides you through each step of the process, from data preprocessing and augmentation to model training and evaluation. Additionally, it offers the flexibility to test the model with custom images. This project is ideal for anyone interested in exploring the capabilities of deep learning in image classification, particularly in distinguishing between these popular household pets. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or a beginner in machine learning, this notebook is designed to be accessible and informative.
